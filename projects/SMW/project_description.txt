I want to create a student management website, where data of 100 students will be stored. It will be accessed by students, their relatives, parents, faculties, college administration. So, a max traffic of 500 people can be expected on a busy day. I want it with React and Ruby on Rails. Use MySQL for database. My budget is 20000 per month. Make it highly scalable, consistent and reliable. It doesn't matter if the updates are slow but, they should always be correct.
