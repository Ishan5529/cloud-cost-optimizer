# Cloud Cost Optimizer CLI

## Overview

The **Cloud Cost Optimizer CLI** is a command-line tool designed to simulate, analyze, and optimize cloud infrastructure costs for software projects.  
It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate **synthetic billing data**, perform **cost analysis**, produce **optimization recommendations**, and export **professional reports** in PDF and HTML formats.

The tool is intentionally designed so that **all analytical reasoning and recommendations are performed by LLMs**, while the application code is responsible only for orchestration, persistence, and presentation.

## Key Features

- **Project Profile Generation**
  - Converts natural language project descriptions into structured project profiles using LLMs.
- **Synthetic Billing Generation**
  - Generates multiple realistic monthly billing scenarios for the same month.
- **Cost Analysis & Optimization**
  - Produces a detailed cost optimization report including:
    - Total cost
    - Budget variance
    - Cost drivers
    - Multi-cloud recommendations
- **View Recommendations**
  - Interactive CLI view for browsing optimization recommendations.
- **Report Export**
  - Export full reports as:
    - **PDF** (well-formatted, multi-page consulting-style report)
    - **HTML** (clean, browser-viewable report)
- **Robust LLM Retry Handling**
  - Automatic retries for deterministic and stable outputs.

## How It Works

### 1. Project Profile Creation
- User provides a natural language project description.
- An LLM converts it into a structured `project_profile.json`.

### 2. Cost Analysis Pipeline
- Synthetic billing data is generated by an LLM.
- Bill is stored in `mock_billing.json`.
- Cost analysis and optimization recommendations are generated **entirely by an LLM**.
- Results are stored in `cost_optimization_report.json`.

### 3. Viewing Recommendations
- Recommendations can be browsed interactively via the CLI.
- One recommendation is displayed at a time.
- Feature to move forward and backwards through CLI interaction.

### 4. Report Export
- A detailed narrative report is generated by an LLM.
- The same content is rendered into:
  - **PDF** using ReportLab
  - **HTML** using a lightweight HTML renderer

## AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT**
  - Used for:
    - PDF generation logic

- **Google AI Studio**
  - Used for:
    - Verifying the realism and consistency of generated synthetic billing data
    - Cross-checking cost distributions and recommendations

---

## Design Principles

- **LLM-Driven Intelligence**
  - All reasoning, analysis, and recommendations are performed by LLMs.
- **No Hard-Coded Cost Logic**
  - No conditional cost analysis or optimization logic exists in application code.
- **Separation of Concerns**
  - LLMs handle intelligence.
  - Python handles orchestration and rendering.
- **Extensible & Modular**
  - Easy to add new export formats or analysis stages.

## How to Run

### Clone this repository on your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishan5529/cloud-cost-optimizer.git
```
### Installing Python
[Download Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

### Create & Activate a project venv
Navigate to the project root directory and setup a virtual python environment.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup .env file
Get your [HuggingFace Access Token (Reader token).](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)  

Create a file called __.env__ in root directory of the project.  
Add the following line to the newly created env file:  
```txt
HF_API_TOKEN=<Your HF Token>
```
### Run the CLI
```bash
python main.py
```

### Example CLI Menu
Cloud Cost Optimizer CLI

1. Enter new project description
2. Run complete cost analysis
3. View recommendations
4. Export report
5. Exit
